                <div class="bio-text">
                    <h3>Early Life and Humble Beginnings</h3>
                    <p>Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born on February 5, 1985, in Funchal, Madeira, Portugal. Named after former US President Ronald Reagan, whom his father admired, Ronaldo grew up in the Santo António neighborhood in a small, modest home with his mother Maria Dolores, father José Dinis Aveiro, and three siblings. Growing up in a humble household, young Cristiano showed exceptional talent from a very early age, playing for amateur team Andorinha where his father worked as a kit man and equipment manager.</p>
                    
                    <p>Despite the financial hardships his family faced, Ronaldo's passion for football was undeniable. He would skip meals to buy a football and spent countless hours perfecting his skills on the streets of Madeira. His natural ability, combined with an unmatched work ethic even as a child, made him stand out among his peers. Local coaches and scouts quickly recognized that this young boy possessed something special - a combination of speed, technical skill, and an unwavering determination to succeed that would eventually take him to the pinnacle of world football.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Youth Career and Sporting CP</h3>
                    <p>At the tender age of 12, Ronaldo made the difficult decision to leave his family and move to Lisbon to join Sporting CP's prestigious youth academy after a successful trial. This was a pivotal moment in his life, as he had to adapt to a new city, new teammates, and the pressure of being away from his family at such a young age. The homesickness was intense, but his mother always encouraged him to pursue his dreams, telling him that this sacrifice would be worth it.</p>
                    
                    <p>At Sporting's academy, Ronaldo's talent flourished under professional coaching. He progressed rapidly through the youth ranks, impressing coaches with his dribbling ability, pace, and goal-scoring instinct. By age 16, he was promoted to Sporting's B team, and just a year later, he made his first-team debut. His performances in the Portuguese league caught the attention of several major European clubs, but it was Manchester United who would win the race for his signature.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Manchester United Era: The Making of a Superstar</h3>
                    <p>In August 2003, at just 18 years old, Ronaldo signed for Manchester United for £12.24 million, becoming the club's first Portuguese player. He was given the legendary number 7 shirt, previously worn by club icons like George Best, Eric Cantona, and David Beckham. The weight of expectation was immense, but Ronaldo was ready for the challenge. Under the guidance of legendary manager Sir Alex Ferguson, Ronaldo transformed from a flashy, trick-obsessed winger into a complete, goal-scoring machine.</p>
                    
                    <p>Ferguson acted as a father figure to the young Portuguese, protecting him from media pressure while pushing him to develop all aspects of his game. The transformation was remarkable. Ronaldo added end product to his skills, became more decisive in front of goal, and developed his now-famous physical prowess through dedicated training. His breakthrough season came in 2006-07, where he scored 23 goals in all competitions and led United to the Premier League title.</p>
                    
                    <p>The 2007-08 season saw Ronaldo reach new heights. He scored an incredible 42 goals in all competitions, won the Premier League, Champions League, and claimed his first Ballon d'Or award. His performances that season are still remembered as some of the best individual displays in football history. He could score with either foot, his head, from free-kicks, and from distance. He had become the complete footballer and was now recognized as the best player in the world.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Real Madrid: Breaking Every Record</h3>
                    <p>In 2009, Ronaldo joined Real Madrid for a then-world record transfer fee of £80 million. The pressure at the Bernabéu was immense - Real Madrid hadn't won the Champions League in seven years, and they were desperate for success. Ronaldo didn't just meet expectations; he exceeded them beyond imagination. Over nine seasons at Madrid, he scored an astonishing 450 goals in 438 appearances, becoming the club's all-time top scorer and leading them to four Champions League titles.</p>
                    
                    <p>During his time in Spain, Ronaldo's rivalry with Barcelona's Lionel Messi pushed both players to unprecedented levels. They consistently scored 50+ goals per season, broke records that seemed unbreakable, and won multiple Ballon d'Or awards each. The El Clásico matches between Real Madrid and Barcelona became the most watched club fixtures in world football, with billions tuning in to watch these two titans battle for supremacy.</p>
                    
                    <p>Ronaldo's time at Madrid was defined by his relentless pursuit of excellence. He became the fastest player to reach 200 goals for the club, scored five goals in a single Champions League match, and won four Champions League titles in five years, including an unprecedented three consecutive victories from 2016 to 2018. His performances in crucial matches earned him the nickname "Mr. Champions League," and he became the competition's all-time leading scorer with over 140 goals.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Juventus, Return to Manchester, and Saudi Arabia</h3>
                    <p>In 2018, at age 33, Ronaldo moved to Juventus for €100 million, proving that age was just a number. In Italy, he continued to defy expectations, winning two Serie A titles and becoming the first player to score 100+ goals in three different top European leagues. His professionalism, fitness regime, and goal-scoring ability remained at the highest level, inspiring teammates and fans alike.</p>
                    
                    <p>In 2021, Ronaldo made an emotional return to Manchester United, the club where he became a superstar. Though his second stint didn't match the success of his first, he still showed glimpses of his brilliance and remained the team's top scorer. Following his departure from United in late 2022, Ronaldo joined Al-Nassr in Saudi Arabia, where he continues to break records and inspire a new generation of footballers in the Middle East.</p>
                    
                    <h3>International Career and Portugal Captain</h3>
                    <p>Ronaldo's international career with Portugal has been equally illustrious. He made his senior debut in 2003 and has since become Portugal's most capped player and all-time top scorer with over 200 appearances and 130+ goals. He led Portugal to their first-ever major trophy at Euro 2016, delivering inspirational leadership despite being injured in the final. In 2019, he captained Portugal to Nations League glory, adding another international trophy to his collection.</p>
                    
                    <p>His dedication to the national team is unparalleled. He has represented Portugal at five World Cups and five European Championships, becoming the only player to score in five different World Cups. His passion for wearing the Portuguese shirt and his leadership qualities have made him a national hero and one of the greatest captains in international football history.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Legacy, Impact, and Philanthropy</h3>
                    <p>Beyond football, Ronaldo's impact extends to philanthropy and business. He has donated millions to charitable causes, including children's hospitals, cancer research, and disaster relief efforts. He regularly donates blood and avoids tattoos specifically so he can continue this life-saving practice. His CR7 brand includes clothing lines, hotels, fragrances, and gyms, making him one of the wealthiest athletes in the world with a net worth exceeding $500 million.</p>
                    
                    <p>Ronaldo's influence on modern football cannot be overstated. His dedication to physical fitness has revolutionized how professional athletes approach training and nutrition. His mental strength, work ethic, and never-give-up attitude have inspired millions of young players worldwide to pursue their dreams. He has proven that with dedication, discipline, and self-belief, anything is possible, regardless of one's background or circumstances.</p>
                    
                    <p>As one of the most followed people on social media with over 600 million followers across platforms, Ronaldo's reach extends far beyond football. He has become a global brand, an icon of success, and a symbol of what can be achieved through hard work and determination. His story from a poor boy in Madeira to becoming one of the greatest footballers of all time continues to inspire people from all walks of life around the world.</p>

                        <p style="line-height: 1.8; color: #555;">Ronaldo's physical attributes are legendary. Standing at 6'2" with incredible athleticism, he possesses exceptional speed, strength, and jumping ability. His vertical leap of 78cm (30.7 inches) allows him to outjump defenders despite not being the tallest player. His sprint speed has been recorded at 33.6 km/h, making him one of the fastest players in football history. His dedication to fitness and training is unmatched, often being the first to arrive and last to leave training sessions.</p>

                        <p style="line-height: 1.8; color: #555;">Ronaldo's technical ability is world-class. He can score with both feet, his head, from free-kicks, penalties, and long-range efforts. His dribbling skills, ball control, and ability to perform tricks at high speed make him unpredictable and difficult to defend against. His shooting technique, particularly his "knuckleball" free-kicks, has become iconic. He has perfected the art of striking the ball with minimal spin, causing it to dip and swerve unpredictably.</p>

                        <p style="line-height: 1.8; color: #555;">What truly sets Ronaldo apart is his mentality. His confidence, determination, and winning mentality are unparalleled. He thrives under pressure, consistently performing in the biggest matches and moments. His ability to bounce back from setbacks, criticism, and injuries demonstrates exceptional mental resilience. He famously said, "Your love makes me strong, your hate makes me unstoppable," embodying his mindset of using all motivation to fuel his success.</p>
